# AGSS 2022 AI ML Workshop Tic Tac Toe
- Let's try AI Tic Tac Toe's!
- There are two Python codes
- `agss_3_1_tic_tac_toe_interactive_v1.py`: you can play against several AI tic tac toe players
- `agss_3_2_tic_tac_toe_statistics_v1.py`: you can set up tic tac toe battle of AI's
- We need these libraries to run the codes:
```
import time
import tkinter as tk
import random
import numpy as np
import math
import copy
```
## Let's play Tic Tac Toe
- With `agss_3_1_tic_tac_toe_interactive_v1.py`, you can choose several tic tac toe AI's to play with
- `python3 agss_3_1_tic_tac_toe_interactive_v1.py`
- ![ttt interactive](https://github.com/Cinderpe1t/AGSS_2022_AI_ML_Workshop_Tic_Tac_Toe/blob/main/agss_ai_ml_tic_tac_toe_interactive.png)
- There are five different AI players.
- Try them all to see what they are like and how they behave.
- Can you beat them? Do you find they are smart or erratic?
- Try to name them with their play style or AI's rules
- Which setup does give you or AI advantage?
- How many games do you need to figure out AI's behavior?
- As simple game it is, can you guess how many possible game combinations are possible?
## AI battle of Tic Tac Toe
- Let's see which AI loses least, or win most
- `python3 agss_3_2_tic_tac_toe_statistics_v1.py`
- ![ttt interactive](https://github.com/Cinderpe1t/AGSS_2022_AI_ML_Workshop_Tic_Tac_Toe/blob/main/agss_ai_ml_tic_tac_toe_battle.png)
- Five AI players were named certain behaviors they implement
- Try combinations of them to see if their match statistics make sense
- Check which one has most win, or least loss
- How many games give you reliable statistics?
